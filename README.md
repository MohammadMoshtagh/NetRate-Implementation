# A Review of Uncovering the Temporal Dynamics of Diffusion Networks
This paper addresses the challenge of understanding diffusion processes, such as informa- tion propagation, virus spread, and product adoption, by introducing a method to infer hidden mechanisms based on observed cascades. The proposed model assumes static but unknown networks, binary infections, independent edge infections, and varying infection times. By for- mulating a generative probabilistic model, the paper presents a scalable algorithm capable of reconstructing network connectivity and temporal dynamics. The innovation lies in modeling diffusion as a discrete network of independent temporal processes, avoiding the need to explic- itly model underlying mechanisms and enabling large-scale analyses. The focus is on continuous temporal dynamics, a novel approach in diffusion modeling.

# NetRate - Implementation 
We have implemented the paper problem using CVXPY library. First, we define the prob- lem as a DCP (Disciplined Convex Programming) in python. For the input data we used Kronecker Graph dataset, which is a common dataset for scoring different approaches in the social computing literature. You can see our results in the next section of this report. You can see more explanation about our implementation in NetRate.ipynb jupyter notebook.
